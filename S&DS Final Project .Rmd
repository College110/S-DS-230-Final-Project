# The Effect of Different Factors on the Success of Movies


## Introduction

In a world where our interactions with digital media inform our everyday decisions and behavior, movies are a powerful form of entertainment that allow us to escape from our daily lives and immerse ourselves in captivating stories and characters. But what makes a high grossing movie so popular? And how exactly is movie grossing and popularity related to budget? In this report, we will analyze how different factors might contribute to the overall popularity and grossing of a movie. We use a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/the-ultimate-film-statistics-dataset-for-ml) obtained from Kaggle, which provides comprehensive movie statistics compiled from various sources. Movies are an integral part of our cultural fabric, and it is important to examine audience preferences in order to gain insight on the common thread of movies as an art form that promotes unity and creativity. 

## Data

```{r}
movies<-read.csv("movie_statistic_dataset.csv")
head(movies)
names(movies)
dim(movies)
```
### Variables Used (renamed during cleaning)
* genres: genres of movies, 20 different categories
* runtimeMins: length of movie in minutes
* averageRating: the average rating given by online users for a particular movie
* numberOfVotes: the number of votes given by online users for a particular movie
* approvalIndex: a normalized indicator (on scale 0-10) calculated by multiplying the logarithm of the number of
votes by the average users rating. It provides a concise measure of a movie's overall popularity and approval among
online viewers, penalizing both films that got too few reviews and blockbusters that got too many.
* productionBudget: production budget in millions of dollars
* domesticGross: domestic earnings in millions of dollars
* worldwideGross: worldwide earnings in millions of dollars
* productionYear: denotes whether the movie came out before/during 2015 or after 2015

## Data Cleaning & Process
```{r}
str(movies)
sum(complete.cases(movies))
movies_com<-movies[complete.cases(movies),]
dim(movies_com)
```

```{r}
movies$director_name<-gsub("-", NA, movies$director_name)
movies$director_professions<-gsub("-", NA, movies$director_professions)
movies$director_birthYear<-gsub("-", NA, movies$director_birthYear)
movies$director_birthYear<-gsub("\\N", NA, movies$director_birthYear)
movies$director_deathYear<-gsub("-", NA, movies$director_deathYear)
movies$director_deathYear<-gsub("\\N", NA, movies$director_deathYear)
movies_com<-na.omit(movies)
head(movies_com)
dim(movies_com)
movies_com$genres
```
*First, we marked all columns with missing information as NA and removed all rows with NA values entirely.*


```{r}
movie1 <- movies_com
Genrelist <- c("Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Drama", "Family", "Fantasy", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller")
indmat <- matrix(0, ncol = length(Genrelist), nrow = nrow(movie1))
colnames(indmat) <- Genrelist

for (i in 1:length(Genrelist)){
  indmat[, i][grep(Genrelist[i], movie1$genres)] <- 1  
}
head(indmat)
movie1$genres[1:10]

movie1 <- cbind(movie1,indmat)
names(movie1)

sum(movie1$Action)
```
*Next, we noticed that each movie is categorized by multiple genres, and each genre is separated by commas in the "genres" column. To fix this, we created a new dataframe called movie1 that takes the genre values from movies_com and creates a binary indicator matrix for the 8 most common genres, appending these genre indicators as additional columns to the original dataset. Each movie is represented by a binary vector indicating the genres it belongs to.*


```{r}
movie1$production_date <- as.numeric(substr(movie1$production_date, 1, 4))
movie1$productionYear <- "After 2015"
movie1$productionYear[movie1$production_date <= 2015] <- "Before or During 2015"
```

*Here, we added a new column to the dataframe called "productionYear" that denotes whether a film was released before/during 2015 or after 2015.*

```{r}
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "movie_title"] <- "title"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "production_date"] <- "productionDate"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "runtime_minutes"] <- "runtimeMins"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "director_name"] <- "directorName"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "director_professions"] <- "directorProfessions"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "director_birthYear"] <- "directorBirthYear"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "director_deathYear"] <- "directorDeathYear"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "movie_averageRating"] <- "averageRating"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "movie_numerOfVotes"] <- "numberOfVotes"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "approval_Index"] <- "approvalIndex"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "Production.budget.."] <- "productionBudget"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "Domestic.gross.."] <- "domesticGross"
names(movie1)[names(movie1) == "Worldwide.gross.."] <- "worldwideGross"

movie1$productionBudget <- movie1$productionBudget/1000000
movie1$domesticGross <- movie1$domesticGross/1000000
movie1$worldwideGross <- movie1$worldwideGross/1000000

head(movie1)
attach(movie1)
```

*Finally, we adjusted the monetary columns to be in millions of dollars and cleaned up the column names in the dataframe so that calling variables would be easier.*

## Plots

```{r}
hist(productionBudget, breaks = 50, col = "red", main = "Histogram of Movie Production Budget", xlab = "Millions of Dollars")

hist(approvalIndex, breaks = 50, col = "orange", main = "Histogram of Movie Approval Index Score", xlab = "Approval Index Score")

boxplot(domesticGross, horizontal = TRUE, col = "blue", lwd = 2, main = "Movie Domestic Gross", xlab = "Millions of Dollars")

plot(productionBudget, approvalIndex, pch = 19, col = "orange", xlab = "Movie Budget (Millions of Dollars)", ylab = "Approval Index Score", main = "Movie Approval Index Score vs. Production Budget")
mtext(paste("Correlation =", round(cor(productionBudget, approvalIndex, use = "complete.obs"), 2)), cex = .8)

plot(log(productionBudget), log(domesticGross), pch = 19, col = "blue", xlab = "Log Movie Budget (Millions of Dollars)", ylab = "Log Domestic Gross (Millions of Dollars)", main = "Movie Domestic Gross vs. Production Budget (Log Scale)")
mtext(paste("Correlation =", round(cor(productionBudget, domesticGross, use = "complete.obs"), 2)), cex = .8)

library(car)
qqPlot(approvalIndex, pch = 19, main = "Normal Quantile Plot of Approval Index")
qqPlot(log(domesticGross), pch = 19, main = "Normal Quantile Plot of Domestic Gross")

```

*To get a sense of the dataset and an overall view on how it behaves, we started off by plotting different variables. We created seven graphs: a histogram of movie produciton budget, a histogram of movie approval index score, a boxplot of movie domestic gross, a scatterplot of movie approval index score vs. production budget, a scatterplot of movie domestic gross vs. production budget on the log scale, a normal quantile plot of approval index, and a normal quantile plot of domestic gross. From these graphs, it is evident that the production budget and the domestic gross are heavily right skewed while the approval index score is approximately normally distributed. There is a somewhat high positive correlation between domestic gross and production budget on the log scale, but the data does not seem to take on any concrete shape. Meanwhile, movie approval index score vs. production budget appear to have a weak positive correlation; the data does not appear to take on any concrete shape here. With the normal quantile plot, we can easily determine that approval index has an approximately normal distribution with few outliers outside of the 95% confidence band. On the other hand, analyzing the normal quantile plot for domestic gross, we can determine that domestic gross data has a significant left skewed nature.*


```{r}
boxplot(log(domesticGross) ~ productionYear, main = "Boxplot of Log Domestic Gross by Production Year", col = c(2, 4), lwd = 2, xlab = "Production Year", ylab = "Log Domestic Gross (Millions of Dollars)")
test1 <- t.test(log(domesticGross) ~ productionYear, conf.level = .99)
test1

summary(domesticGross)
```

*We decided to specifically analyze the relationship between production year and domestic gross (on the log scale) -- does the passage of time have an effect on how well movies do? From the boxplots, there doesn't seem to be a visible relationship between the log of domestic gross and production year, since both timeframes have similar medians and interquartile ranges. However, there are some outliers, especially in the "Before or During 2015" category, which can have a large effect on the overall relationship between the two variables. From the t-test, we can conclude that the true difference in means between movies released After 2015 and movies released Before or During 2015 is not equal to 0, because the p-value is less than the threshold of 0.05 and the confidence interval does not capture the value of 0.*


```{r}
set.seed(230) 
N <- 10000
diffGross <- rep(NA, N)
for (i in 1:N) {
  sB <- sample(log(domesticGross[productionYear == "Before or During 2015"]),
               sum(productionYear == "Before or During 2015"), replace = TRUE)
  sA <- sample(log(domesticGross[productionYear == "After 2015"]),
               sum(productionYear == "After 2015"), replace = TRUE)
  diffGross[i] <- mean(sA) - mean(sB)
}

ci <- quantile(diffGross, c(0.005, 0.995))
round(ci, 2)

hist(diffGross, col = "blue", main = "Bootstrapped Sample Mean Diff in Domestic Gross of Movies (Log Scale)", xlab = "Log Domestic Gross (Millions of Dollars)", breaks = 50, cex.main = 1.0)

abline(v = ci, lwd = 3, col = "red")
abline(v = test1$conf.int, lwd = 3, col = "green", lty = 2)
legend("topright", c("Original CI", "Boot CI"), lwd = 3, col = c("green", "red"), lty = c(2,1))
```

*The bootstrapped sample results of the mean difference in domestic gross of movies (on the log scale) affirm the conclusion we drew from the t-test. Both the original and bootstrapped confidence intervals are pretty similar--the bootstrapped CI has a slightly larger range. Neither CI has the value zero in it, which is evidence that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean differences in domestic gross.*


```{r}
set.seed(230)

diffMedian <- by(log(domesticGross), productionYear, median)
diffMedian <- diffMedian["After 2015"] - diffMedian["Before or During 2015"]

N <- 10000
diffvals <- rep(NA, N)

for (i in 1:N) {
  fakeyear <- sample(productionYear)
  diffvals[i] <- median(log(domesticGross[fakeyear == "After 2015"])) - median(log(domesticGross[fakeyear == "Before or During 2015"]))
}

hist(diffvals, main = "Permuted Sample Median Diff in Domestic Gross (Log Scale)", xlab = "Log Domestic Gross (Millions of Dollars)", col = "blue", breaks = 30)
abline(v = diffMedian, col = "red", lwd = 3)
text(diffMedian + 0.03, 550, paste("Actual Diff in Medians =", round(diffMedian,2)), srt = 90)

mean(abs(diffvals) >= abs(diffMedian))
```
*In the last visual representation for log domestic gross by production year, we performed a permutation test to obtain a p-value for a hypothesis test. The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between median domestic gross for movies released before/during 2015 and after 2015. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a statistically significant difference between median domestic gross for movies released before/during 2015 and after 2015. From the p-value, we can conclude that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected because the p-value of 0.49 is greater than 0.05. This is shown in the histogram as the red line denoting the actual difference in medians lies within the permuted sample median values.*

```{r}
names(movie1)
movie2 <- movie1[, c(13, 12, 15:22, 2, 4, 9, 10, 11)]
names(movie2)
dim(movie2)
```
*Here, we wanted to fit a model that looks at possible predictors of domestic earnings (domestic gross the on log scale). In order to do this, we made a new dataset above called 'movie2' that contains most of the relevant columns.*

```{r}
library(leaps)
mod <- regsubsets(log(movie2$domesticGross) ~ ., data = movie2, nvmax = length(movie2) - 1)
modsum <- summary(mod)
modsum$which
```
*Above, we performed best subsets regression using the 'regsubsets' function in the 'leaps' package and displayed 'modsum$which' in order to get a decent sense on what variables in 'movie2' are being included in each step of the best subsets regression.*

```{r}
modnum <- which.max(modsum$rsq)
names(movie2)[modsum$which[modnum, ]][-1]
movietemp <- movie2[, modsum$which[modnum, ]]
summary(lm(log(domesticGross) ~ ., data = movietemp))
```
```{r}
modnumadj <- which.max(modsum$adjr2)
names(movie2)[modsum$which[modnumadj, ]][-1]
movietempadj <- movie2[ ,modsum$which[modnumadj, ]]
summary(lm(log(domesticGross) ~ ., data = movietempadj))
```
```{r}
modnumBic <- which.min(modsum$bic)
names(movie2)[modsum$which[modnumBic, ]][-1]
movietempBic <- movie2[ ,modsum$which[modnumBic, ]]
summary(lm(log(domesticGross) ~ ., data = movietempBic))
```
```{r}
modnumCP <- min(c(1:length(modsum$cp))[modsum$cp <= c(1:length(modsum$cp)) + 1])
names(movie2)[modsum$which[modnumCP, ]][-1]
movietempCP <- movie2[ ,modsum$which[modnumCP, ]]
summary(lm(log(domesticGross) ~ ., data = movietempCP))
```

```

## ANOVA Analysis

In further trying to answer the question of what combination of factors contribute to producing the most successful film, we next look at the success of films depending on the primary profession of it's director. In the data we have been using so far, the column "directorProfessions" has multiple entries separated by commas since most of the directors have multiple professional roles that they choose between depending on the movie. We can see that these entries are not in alphabetical order, but rather in the order of the most appropriate profession for each director, therefore we choose to only use the first entry. To do this, we create a new column in the 'movie1' called 'primary_profession'. Then, we print a table to see the distribution of professions. 

```{r}

movie1$primary_profession <- sapply(strsplit(as.character(movie1$directorProfessions), split = ","), "[", 1)
(tabular_primary_profession <- data.frame(sort(table(movie1$primary_profession), decreasing = T)))

```
From this table, we can see that there are four main professions that account for the majority of the movies: director, producer, writer and actor. The rest 19 are small groups comprising of a wide array of specialized film production roles. Expect, the 5th largest group which is actress. To narrow down this spread for an appropriate analysis, we club the entries which should fall into the same category using 'gsub'. Namely: we combine 'actor' and 'actress' into a new category called 'movie star'; 'assistant director' and 'director' into only one category called 'director'; and all the remaining professions into 'other'. Then, we print the same table to see the distribution with our final categories. 


```{r}

movie1$primary_profession <- gsub("actor|actress", "movie star", movie1$primary_profession)
movie1$primary_profession <- gsub("assistant_director", "director", movie1$primary_profession)
movie1$primary_profession <- gsub("miscellaneous|cinematographer|editor|visual_effects|art_department|soundtrack|stunts|camera_department|animation_department|composer|editorial_department|music_artist|music_department|special_effects|production_designer|sound_department|art_director|casting_director", "other", movie1$primary_profession)

(tabular_primary_profession <- data.frame(sort(table(movie1$primary_profession), decreasing = T)))

```

All the five categories seem to have sufficient frequency to proceed with the analysis. We begin by seeing the gross domestic income by the primary profession of the director. 

```{r}

boxplot(movie1$domesticGross ~ movie1$primary_profession, xlab = "Primary Profession of Director", ylab = "Gross Income (Millions of Dollars)", col = "blue", main = "Boxplot of Gross Income \nby Primary Professional of Director", cex = 0.8)
means <- tapply(movie1$domesticGross, movie1$primary_profession, mean) 
points(means, col = "red", pch = 20, cex = 1.2)

```
The medians and means of gross income have similar across the professions so they follow similar skewness; however, it seems clear that producers have the highest grocing movies on average with the highest quartile values, median and mean. Although, looking at the spread of the boxplot across the y-axis, it seems that because of massively highly grossing films, we might need a log transformation before using ANOVA. To further investigate if other issues such as heteroskedasticity, we calculate the ratio of the largest to smallest sample standard deviation. 


```{r}
(std_dev <- tapply(movie1$domesticGross, movie1$primary_profession, sd))
max(std_dev)/min(std_dev)

```

We find a value of 1.7621, which is less than 2 therefore demonstrating that the variances are indeed the same across professions. Next, we develop our ANOVA model, 'aov1' that compares the means of domestic gross between the professions to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the professions. 

```{r}

aov1 <- aov(movie1$domesticGross ~ movie1$primary_profession) 
summary(aov1)

```

We find a f-value of <2e-16 that is less than the alpha value (0.05), allowing us to reject the null hypothesis and find there is a statistically significant difference in the gross income acorss the movies produced by directors of different primary professions. 


```{r}

library(plotrix)
mod1 <- lm(movie1$domesticGross ~ movie1$primary_profession - 1)
summary(mod1)


conf_int <- confint(mod1)
round(conf_int, 2)


(coefs <- coef(mod1))
par(mar = c(5, 8, 4, 2))


plotCI(coefs, 1:(length(coefs)), ui = conf_int[,2], li = conf_int[,1], axes = F, lwd = 2, main = "Mean and CIs for Percentage Return \nby Movie Genre", col = "green", err = "x", ylab = "", xlab = "Mean (and 95% CI)")


axis(side = 1)
axis(side = 2, at = 1:(length(coefs)), label = levels(as.factor(movie1$primary_profession)), las = 2)

```
Since most of the group's true means don't fall inside the confidence intervals, we cannot conclude much from this plot and try to use Holm’s correction for comparing pairs of means and find pairs of professions that have statistically significantly different gross returns.

```{r}

pairwise.t.test(movie1$domesticGross, movie1$primary_profession)

```

Based on the table, we find that the pairs that have statistically significantly different percent returns with a p-value of <0.05 (alpha value) are: other - movie star, producer - director, producer - movie star, producer - other, writer - movie star, writer - movie star, writer - producer. We further verify whether these are accurate by calculating Tukey simultaneous 95% confidence intervals for differences in mean percent return using the TukeyHSD() function. 

```{r}

TukeyHSD(aov1)

par(mar = c(5, 11, 4, 1)) 
plot(TukeyHSD (aov1), las = 1)

```

We reach different conclusions than when using the Holm correction, as using the Tukey simultaneous 95% confidence intervals, finding that the pairs that have statistically significantly different percent returns are: producer-director, producer-movie star, producer-other, writer-producer. Lastly, we plot the residual plots to see if they have normal distributions and display any signs of heteroskedasticity to judge this model's fit. 

```{r}

myResPlots2(aov1)

```

The residual plot does not seem normally distributed with extreme deviations from linearity on both tails. However, there do not seem to be signs of heteroskedasticity but slightly professions seem slightly right skewed. To address these issues, we use a boxCox() function to see what kind of transformation is recommended. 

```{r}

trans1 <- boxCox(mod1)

trans1$x[which.max(trans1$y)]

```

We find a recommended value of 0.2222 for the power of lambda, and the proximity to zero of the log-likelihood graph suggests a natural log transformation. So, we repeat the entire process we just did by creating a new column called 'transformed_gross' with a transformed value of domesticgross to the value found using boxCox above: 0.2222. 

```{r}

movie1$transformed_gross <- movie1$domesticGross^0.2222

boxplot(movie1$transformed_gross ~ movie1$primary_profession, xlab = "Genre of Movie", ylab = "Approval Index", col = "blue", main = "Boxplot of Approval Index by Movie Genre", cex = 0.8)
means <- tapply(movie1$transformed_gross, movie1$primary_profession, mean) 
points(means, col = "red", pch = 20, cex = 1.2)

```
The boxplots demonstrate lesser variance across the groups and address the issues of spread. As before, we calculate the ratio of the maximum and minimum standard deviation to decide whether the variance is suitable to apply ANOVA. 

```{r}

#library(lattice)
#stripplot(movie1$transformed_gross ~ movie1$primary_profession, xlab = "Genre of Movie", ylab = "Approval Index", jitter = 0.1, main = "Approval Index by Movie Genre")

(std_dev <- tapply(movie1$transformed_gross, movie1$primary_profession, sd))
max(std_dev)/min(std_dev)

```

With a value of 1.117636 that is less than 2, the variances are seem across the professions and we can develop our new transformed ANOVA model. 

```{r}

aov2 <- aov(movie1$transformed_gross ~ movie1$primary_profession) 
summary(aov2)

```


```{r}

library(plotrix)
mod1 <- lm(movie1$transformed_gross ~ movie1$primary_profession - 1)
summary(mod1)


conf_int <- confint(mod1)
round(conf_int, 2)


(coefs <- coef(mod1))
par(mar = c(5, 8, 4, 2))


plotCI(coefs, 1:(length(coefs)), ui = conf_int[,2], li = conf_int[,1], axes = F, lwd = 2, main = "Mean and CIs for Percentage Return \nby Movie Genre", col = "green", err = "x", ylab = "", xlab = "Mean (and 95% CI)")


axis(side = 1)
axis(side = 2, at = 1:(length(coefs)), label = levels(as.factor(movie1$primary_profession)), las = 2)


TukeyHSD(aov2)

par(mar = c(5, 11, 4, 1)) 
plot(TukeyHSD (aov2), las = 1)

myResPlots2(aov2)

```
Overall, this model proves to be a better fit and provides better evidence that there is a statistically significant difference between the groups. This is evidenced by the normal quantile plots of the studentized residuals which demonstrates that they are approximately normally distributed and the Fits vs Studentized residual plots that display no clear signs of heteroskedasticity and far lesser right skewness.

Going through results, we can conclude that we can reject the null hypothesis with a f-statistic p-value of <2.2e-16, suggesting that there is a statistically significant difference across the groups, and then our model finds a much higher Multiple R-squared of 0.9047. Moroever, even though many of the group means don't exactly overall with the confidence intervals, we can see that producer's and writer's have the highest movie gross income amounts. The Tukey comparisons ascertain the following are the statitically significant pairings: producer-director, producer-movie star, producer-other and writer-producer. From the inclusion of producer is all pairings, it is further clear that having a director who is a producer by their primary profession has the highest probability of creating a high grossing movie.
